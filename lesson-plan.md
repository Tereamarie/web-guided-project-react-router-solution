# Lesson Plan

## DOM APIs

Motivation: we can navigate the browser using JavaScript alone

* Introduce the old `location` object in the console and demo `location.reload()`.
* Introduce the newer History API and demo its `go`, `back`, `forward` and `pushState` methods.
* With the History API we can manipulate the pathname of the URL without causing browser reload.
* We cannot use the History API alone in React because components wouldn't know to re-render.
* The pathname in the URL becomes part of application state: it keeps track of what components display.
